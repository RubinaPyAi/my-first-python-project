# My First Python & Git Learning Repository  

This repository is created to practice **Git, GitHub, and Python programming** as part of my learning journey. I have explored various Git commands and worked with small Python programs while understanding version control concepts.  

## **What I Have Learned Here**  

### ✅ Git & GitHub Commands Practiced  
- Initializing a Git repository (`git init`)  
- Cloning a repository (`git clone`)  
- Staging & committing changes (`git add`, `git commit`)  
- Creating & switching branches (`git branch`, `git checkout`, `git switch`)  
- Pushing & pulling changes (`git push`, `git pull`)  
- Merging branches (`git merge`) and resolving conflicts  
- Undoing changes (`git reset`, `git revert`, `git checkout`)  

### ✅ Python Programs Added  
- Small Python programs for **basic syntax practice**  
- Using Python for **loops, conditionals, functions, and file handling**  
- Practicing **simple scripts** to strengthen Python fundamentals  

## **Why This Repository?**  
This repository serves as a hands-on **Git practice workspace** where I test commands and understand Git workflows, while also improving my Python coding skills.
